        — i default to <span class="hl one">third person present tense</span>, but can also do past tense.
        
        — threads > comms.
        
        — in my short post era, so around <span class="hl two">150 - 300 words</span> per post.
        
        — usually, <span class="hl three">mxf or fxf,</span></span> but i'm open to other ships if that’s where our writing takes us. i prefer playing men and i don't care at all about switching off.
        
        — i usually stick to a <span class="hl one">3/3/2</span> rating (violence/language/sexual content, respectively), but may make exceptions for established writing partners.
        
        — i'm not one to stick with end games/finals, but i do prefer <span class="hl two">chatting before writing</span> so we can get a feel for the plot, our muses, etc.

        — <3 long term plots and partners. i also like <span class="hl three">collaborative worldbuilding</span> and partners who are enthusiastic about engaging in a back-and-forth dialogue about lore.

        — i post anywhere from <span class="hl one">1-4 times a week,</span> depending on the thread.

        — i typically reach out through discord and dm anyone who takes my plots. if i don't get a reply <span class="hl two">after three days,</span> i'll go ahead and reopen it. (this doesn’t apply to open threads)
        
        — threads get archived after <span class="hl three">four weeks</span> of inactivity, but i'm down to reopen if we're both still interested.
