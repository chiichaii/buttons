        â€” i default to <span class="hl one">third person present tense</span>, but can also do past tense.
        
        â€” threads > comms.
        
        â€” in my short post era, so around <span class="hl two">150 - 300 words</span> per post.
        
        â€” usually, <span class="hl three">mxf or fxf,</span></span> but i'm open to other ships if thatâ€™s where our writing takes us. i prefer playing men and i don't care at all about switching off.
        
        â€” i prefer <span class="hl one">fading to black,</span> but may make exceptions for established writing partners.
        
        â€” i like <span class="hl two">chatting before writing,</span> about the plot, our characters, potential plot or character arcs, but i don't like predetermined endings or end games. my style is more 'lay the groundwork, but keep things flexible enough so we go where our writing takes us.'

        â€” ðŸ©· long-term plots and partners. i also like <span class="hl three">collaborative worldbuilding</span> and partners who are enthusiastic about engaging in a back-and-forth dialogue about lore.

        â€” i post anywhere from <span class="hl two">1-4 times a week,</span> depending on the thread.

        â€” i typically reach out through discord and dm anyone who takes my plots. if i don't get a reply <span class="hl three">after three days,</span> i'll go ahead and reopen it. (this doesnâ€™t apply to open threads)
        
        â€” threads get archived after <span class="hl one">four weeks</span> of inactivity, but i'm down to reopen if we're both still interested.
